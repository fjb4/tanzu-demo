# VMware Tanzu Demo

Demo material for developers on [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/).

Consists of three [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) microservices, communicating over [RabbitMQ](), backed by a Redis key value store, all running on Kubernetes.
When source code changes, the applications are rebuilt using [Build Service](https://tanzu.vmware.com/build-service) and redeployed to [TKG](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid) using ArgoCD GitOps.

Both Kubernetes clusters are managed using [Mission Control](https://tanzu.vmware.com/mission-control) and both infrastructure, Kubernetes, applications and services are monitored using [Observability by Wavefront](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability).

## Installation

Prior to demoing:
- Remove any existing container images from Docker Hub
- Copy the `config.template.yml` to config.yml and fill in the values.
- Create the Kubernetes clusters by running `create-clusters.sh`.
- After the clusters have been created:
  - Run `get-kubeconfig.sh > ~/.kube/config` to overwrite your kubeconfig file with connection information for the new clusters.
  - Run `prep-clusters.sh`.
  - Onboard the clusters into Tanzu Service Mesh and create the "acme.com" GNS.

Then follow the instructions in the `setup_all.sh` script to install everything from scratch.

Alternatively, install the different components by running the various setup scripts.

- Install kpack using `01-install-kpack.sh`.
- Install argocd using `02-install-argocd.sh`.
- Configure the credentials for the various services in `03-configure-credentials.sh`.
- Configure the GitOps resources using `04-configure-gitops.sh`.
- Configure service mesh using `05-configure-mesh.sh`.

To access the Argo CD user interface:
- Get the host name for Argo CD `kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd -o json | jq ".status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname"`.
- Get admin user's autogenerated password `kubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2 | pbcopy`.
- Open the loadbalancer address in your browser and login as `admin` with the above password.

Get the host name of the ingress gateway: `kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system`.

When you're done, delete all the clusters by running `delete-clusters.sh`.
